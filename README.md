The dataset consisted of four interconnected tables, each contributing critical elements to the sales analysis. The "Sales Orders" sheet served as the primary source for transaction data, encompassing details such as order numbers, dates, customer indices, sales channels, product descriptions, quantities ordered, unit pricing, and revenue figures. This table provided the core framework for understanding sales trends, customer preferences, and revenue generation across different regions.

The "Customers" sheet offered insights into customer demographics by listing customer indices alongside names, enabling the mapping of individual customers to specific orders. This sheet was instrumental in identifying key customer segments and their purchasing behaviors.

Geographical data was stored in the "Regions" sheet, which provided a breakdown of locations using suburbs, cities, postcodes, and geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude). This spatial information was essential for regional sales analysis, helping to visualize sales distribution and identify high-performing areas.

Finally, the "Products" sheet cataloged product names linked to their respective indices. This allowed for detailed product-level analysis, including performance tracking of individual products and categories, facilitating inventory and marketing strategies.

These interconnected tables collectively allowed for a comprehensive analysis of sales performance, customer engagement, and regional impact, supporting strategic decision-making in business operations. Let me know if additional details or refinements are needed. ​​
